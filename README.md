# Watson Innovation - Group 6 - VU Amsterdam 

This repository contains a prototypical implementation of a cognitive app, which was developed to tackle the issue of overcrowding in the city center of Amsterdam. 
The prototype is an Android application which was tested using a Google Nexus 5X Smartphone in combination with Android 8.0.0. Using other Android versions or devices could lead to unintended behaviour of the app. 
This will be mitigated in the future by conducting intensive application tests on different devices. 

## Getting Started

To test the developed app, one either needs Android Studio, in combination with and emulated virtual device or an physical Smartphone with enables USB debugging mode.

### Starting the app

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be


End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
